Screenshothis is an **open-source** service that lets you programmatically capture beautiful, high-resolution images of any web page. With a single HTTP request you can generate full-page screenshots, device-specific view-ports, PDFs, or thumbnails‚Äîperfect for previews, social cards, reports, or automated testing.

## Why Screenshothis?

- ‚ö°Ô∏è Lightning-fast Chromium rendering (headless Chrome)
- üé® Automatic high-DPI output up to 4K
- üìê Custom viewport, device emulation & full-page support
- üõ†Ô∏è Flexible query parameters for delay, JS injection, dark-mode, and more
- üîí Built-in rate-limiting, CSP-bypass auditing & token authentication
- üèóÔ∏è Docker-first, stateless architecture that scales horizontally
- üÜì 100 % API-first & AGPL-3.0 open-source

> "Take the pain out of screenshots so you can focus on your **product**, not your browser."

## Quick example

```bash
curl "https://api.screenshothis.com/v1/screenshot?url=https://github.com&device=desktop&fullPage=true"
```

The API responds with a PNG image (or JSON metadata when `output=json` is requested).

## Typical use-cases

1. Generate social-media preview images (`og:image`) for dynamic pages.
2. Show live website thumbnails in dashboards, newsletters, or link previews.
3. Create PDF snapshots of invoices, reports, or documentation.
4. Visual regression testing in CI pipelines.
