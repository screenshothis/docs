## Getting started quickly

### Base URL

Make all API requests to our production server:

```
https://api.screenshothis.com
```

### Authentication

Authenticate using API keys passed as query parameters. You'll create your API key in the [dashboard](https://screenshothis.com/keys).

**API key security**

Your API keys use domain whitelisting for security—you can safely commit them to version control. Keys only work on domains you've whitelisted in your dashboard.

**Authentication examples**

Add your API key as a query parameter in every request:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="JavaScript (SDK)">
```javascript
import { Screenshothis } from '@screenshothis/sdk';

const apiKey = 'your_api_key_here';
const url = 'https://example.com';

const screenshothis = new Screenshothis();

const screenshot = await screenshothis.screenshots.take({
  apiKey,
  url,
});
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="cURL">
```bash
curl "https://api.screenshothis.com/v1/screenshots/take?api_key=your_api_key&url=https://example.com"
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Python">
```python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    'https://api.screenshothis.com/v1/screenshots/take',
    params={
        'api_key': 'your_api_key',
        'url': 'https://example.com'
    }
)
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
**Domain whitelisting**: Configure allowed domains in your [dashboard](https://screenshothis.com/keys) to control where your API key can be used. This security model makes it safe to use API keys client-side and commit them to version control.

## Usage limits and rate limiting

We enforce fair usage limits to ensure optimal performance for everyone:

| Plan | Requests per minute | Screenshots per month |
|------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **Free** | 10 | 100 |
| **Pro** | 60 | 1,000+ |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Custom |

### Monitor your usage

Check your current usage with these response headers:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 10
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 9
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

<Tip>
Monitor these headers to implement proper retry logic and avoid hitting rate limits
</Tip>

## Error handling

We use standard HTTP status codes and return structured JSON error responses to help you diagnose issues quickly.

### Error response structure

When an error occurs, you receive JSON with detailed information:

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid API key provided",
  "requestId": "req_1234567890abcdef"
}
```

### HTTP status codes

| Status Code | Meaning | When it happens |
|-------------|---------|------------------|
| `200` | Success | Screenshot captured successfully |
| `400` | Bad Request | Invalid parameters or malformed URL |
| `403` | Forbidden | Invalid API key or quota exceeded |
| `429` | Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded |
| `500` | Internal Server Error | Server-side error occurred |

### Common error examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Invalid API Key">
```json
{
  "error": "Invalid API key provided",
  "requestId": "req_1234567890abcdef"
}
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Quota Exceeded">
```json
{
  "error": "Screenshot quota exceeded for current billing period",
  "requestId": "req_abcdef1234567890"
}
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Rate Limited">
```json
{
  "error": "Too many requests. Please wait before retrying.",
  "requestId": "req_fedcba0987654321"
}
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Invalid URL">
```json
{
  "error": "Invalid URL provided. Must include protocol (http:// or https://)",
  "requestId": "req_0123456789abcdef"
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
Always include error handling in your applications. Save the `requestId` from error responses—our support team uses this to help troubleshoot issues faster
</Warning>

## Response formats

### Image responses

You receive screenshot images directly as binary data:

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl "https://api.screenshothis.com/v1/screenshots/take?api_key=your_api_key&url=https://example.com" \
  -o screenshot.jpeg
```
</RequestExample>

<ResponseExample>
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: image/jpeg
Content-Length: 245760
Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600

[Binary image data]
```
</ResponseExample>

The `Content-Type` header matches your requested format:
- `image/jpeg` for JPEG format
- `image/png` for PNG format
- `image/webp` for WebP format

## Request limits

We enforce these limits for security and performance:

| Limit Type | Maximum | Purpose |
|------------|---------|---------|
| **Headers** | 8KB | Total size of custom HTTP headers |
| **Cookies** | 4KB | Total size of custom cookies |
| **URL length** | 2048 characters | Standard browser compatibility |
| **Request timeout** | 30 seconds | Maximum screenshot generation time |

<Note>
These limits support the vast majority of legitimate use cases while preventing abuse
