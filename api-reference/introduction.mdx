## Base URL

All API requests are made to:

```
https://api.screenshothis.com
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using API keys passed as query parameters. You can obtain your API key from the [dashboard](https://screenshothis.com/keys).

### API Key Format

- **Test keys**: Start with `ss_test_` for development and testing
- **Live keys**: Start with `ss_live_` for production use

### Authentication Method

API keys are passed as query parameters in requests:

```bash
curl "https://api.screenshothis.com/v1/screenshots/take?api_key=ss_test_your_key&url=https://example.com"
```

<Info>
**Domain Whitelisting**: API keys can be safely used in client-side applications thanks to domain whitelisting. Configure allowed domains in your [dashboard](https://screenshothis.com/keys) to restrict where your API key can be used.
</Info>

## Rate Limits

Rate limiting is enforced per API key to ensure fair usage:

- **Free tier**: 10 requests per minute, 100 screenshots per month
- **Paid plans**: Higher limits based on your subscription

Rate limit headers are included in all responses:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 10
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 9
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

## Error Responses

The API uses standard HTTP status codes and returns structured error responses:

### Error Format

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid API key",
  "requestId": "req_123456789"
}
```

### Common Status Codes

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `200` | Success - Screenshot generated |
| `400` | Bad Request - Invalid parameters |
| `403` | Forbidden - Invalid API key or quota exceeded |
| `429` | Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded |
| `500` | Internal Server Error - Server-side error |

## Response Formats

### Image Response (Default)

By default, the API returns the screenshot image directly as binary data:

```bash
curl "https://api.screenshothis.com/v1/screenshots/take?api_key=YOUR_KEY&url=https://example.com" \
  -o screenshot.jpeg
```

**Content-Type**: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, or `image/webp` based on the `format` parameter.

## Request Limits

For security and performance, the following limits are enforced:

- **Headers**: Maximum 8KB total size
- **Cookies**: Maximum 4KB total size
- **URL length**: Standard browser limits apply
- **Request timeout**: 30 seconds maximum
